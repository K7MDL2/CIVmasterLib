This is heavily modified fork from https://github.com/WillyIoBrok/CIVmasterLib.  I thank him for the head start in my project.

I have modified this library to suit my Teensy CI-V band decoder and hardware remote control interface for the IC-905 and soon, some other CI-V radios like the IC-705, mostly for the purpose of band decoding and transverter interface UI and controls. 

This lib is required for my main project at https://github.com/K7MDL2/ICOM_IC-905_CIV.
